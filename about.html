    <h2>About G.M. University</h2>
    <p>
        Gangadhar Meher University (GMU), Sambalpur,has come into being on the 30th May 2015 by agovernment of Odisha order (no.11598/HE Dated 30.05.2015). A long-awaited moment has come to be fulfilled for the youth and people of the region aspiring for higher education. The new university has taken off from the erstwhileGangadhar Meher Autonomous College with the entire teaching and nonteaching staff deployed to the university to discharge immediate academic and administrative duties.

        This elevation is indeed the crowning glory for an institution whose origin goes back to pre-independent India. The intellectuals and the then administrators formed a trust and through it established a college and named it after the town; thus, Sambalpur College was born in the year 1944. With growth and increased popularity, it was renamed after the literary luminary of the region asGangadhar Meher College in 1949. Science stream was introduced in the year 1957; postgraduate programs were introduced and autonomy granted in 1964 and 1991 respectively. Another landmark was the recognition by the University Grants Commission as the ?College with Potential for Excellence (CPE) and accreditation with ?A? grade by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) in 2005 and 2015 respectively. Its continuous growth and later upgradation as unitary university is due to its ability to meet the higher educational needs of the students of the region. Students have always made it their first preference college. The application to seat ratio is always impressive, making a case for its continuous expansion. Consequently, the alumni base and support has grown to become one of the best not just in Odisha but in the whole country with many of them rendering distinguished service in the political, bureaucratic, and scientific establishments. The government, acknowledging this legacy, has identified it as a heritage institution.

        The university currently has 6449 strong student community in 26 PG and 28 UG and 23 PhD programs. E- Governance, IT skill centre, E-resource centre in the already well- stocked and used library, Central Instrumentation Facility, Functional Memoranda of Understanding with national level institutions, 4 IT laboratories, 9 hostels, Well-maintained sports field, 1200 seated auditorium, three storied utility centre with a bank, canteen, creche, stationary, a gym and other allied facilities and a developing second campus along with more than 200 regular, contractual and guest faculties and complementing administrative staff form part of the growth trajectory of this new university with an age old history.

        Implementing New Education policy with necessary emphasis on Indian Knowledge system (IKS), imparting multidisciplinary education with employable skill sets, establishing industry linkages, striving for cutting edge research and publication and, most important of all, reaching out to the marginalised sections, especially the tribal communities of region, G M University is pursuing its well-defined institutional goals with dedication and commitment, led by the incumbent Vice-Chancellor.
